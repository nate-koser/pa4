- The mean center of gravity measurement in Hz for [s] was `r round(mean(s$cogval), 2)`.
- The mean skewness measurement in [s] was `r round(mean(s$skewness), 2)`.
- The mean center of gravity measurement in Hz for [ʃ] was `r round(mean(sh$cogval), 2)`.
- The mean skewness measurement for [ʃ] was `r round(mean(sh$skewness), 2)`.

#Discussion of Results

The model evaluates the hypothesized bivariate relationship between center of gravity and skewness among [s] segements. The model diagnostics indicate a strong correlation between the two variables. 

A check of the confidence interval reveals a 95% probability of the center of gravity intercept being between 7581.14 ~ 8473.33, which our estimated value of 8027.20 falls within. The same is true for the slope of [s] skewness, where we see an interval of 2484.67 ~ 3573.53. The estimated value is again well within this range. These estimated
values are determined to be significant at the p < .0001 level, and our R-squared value 
indicates that 87.71% of the variance is accounted for. 

A glance at a scatterplot of the two variables suggests a strong positive correlation with relative normal distribution. Other model diagnostics support this observation. The mean of the residuals is effectively zero (1.13e-14) and the Pearson's correlation coefficient comes in at about .94, suggesting a close relationship.

#Discussion of Results

Plotting the residuals versus the fitted values shows that the data are homoskedastic, though one or two influential data points may be present. A Q-Q plot shows tight distribution around the mean other than the aforementioned outliers. A check of Cook's distance confirms the presence of two influential data points that may be affecting the shape of the model.   

Despite the presence of outliers, every test of statistical significance examined so far indicates that there is a positive relationship between [s] center of gravity and [s] skewness - as one increases, so does the other. The null hypothesis can be rejected in favor of the alternative hypothesis. This is what the linear model tells us.
