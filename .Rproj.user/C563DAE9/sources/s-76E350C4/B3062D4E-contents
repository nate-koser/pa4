```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r my_setup, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(languageR)
```
### Tidy Data Set

Here I select a few relevant variables.
```{r data, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
my_data <- ratings %>%
  select(., Word, Frequency, Familiarity = meanFamiliarity)
```

### Descriptive Statistics

Here I calculate the mean frequency of all the words.

```{r stats, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
mean(my_data[, 'Frequency'])
```

### The Model and The Plot

Here I fit the model and plot the variables with a 
regression line.

```{r model, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
my_fit <- lm(Frequency ~ Familiarity, 
             data = my_data)
summary(my_fit)

ggplot(my_data, aes(x=Frequency, y=Familiarity))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE)+
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(2.4, 7.3), ylim = c(1.5,6))+
  labs(title = "Word Familiarity and Frequency")
```

### Observations

We observe a positive relationship between word
frequency and subjective word familiarity. This 
makes sense intuitively - the more often a person 
encounters a word, the more familiar they should be
with it. \
Familiarity bottoms out around 2, suggesting that
the words presented were all known in some way to the subjects, or perhaps that subjects were unlikely to give a rating of zero.
